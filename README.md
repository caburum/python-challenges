# Python Challenges
These are some small Python challenges. They all include the problem, solution, and unit testing.

## Testing
`main.py` will run unit tests on every challenge. Running an individual challenge file will run tests just on it.

## Contrubuting
Feel free to contribute new challenges, as long as they include a prompt that others can use to create their code and passing tests.
